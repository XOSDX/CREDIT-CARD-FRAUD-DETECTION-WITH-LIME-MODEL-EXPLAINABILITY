# Credit Card Fraud Detection System with Explainable AI (LIME)

## Overview

This project focuses on building a robust **Credit Card Fraud Detection System** based on multiple features. It leverages machine learning techniques for accurate detection and incorporates **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)** to provide explainability, making the predictions interpretable and transparent.

## Features

- **Multiple Feature Analysis**: Considers a variety of features in the dataset to enhance the accuracy of fraud detection.
- **Explainable AI**: Uses LIME to interpret model predictions, offering insights into the decision-making process of the model.
- **Fraud Detection**: Detects fraudulent transactions based on the given input data, aiding in preventing unauthorized activities.

## Project Structure

- **Notebook**: `PROJECT_2_CREDIT_CARD_FRAUD_DETECTION_SYSTEM_ON_BASIS_OF_MULTIPLE_FEATURES_WITH_NECESSARY_EXPLAINABILITY_USING_LIME_XAI_MODEL.ipynb`  
  Contains the entire code and workflow for data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and interpretability using LIME.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- LIME (for interpretability)

Install the dependencies with:  pip install -r requirements.txt


## Installation

1. Clone this repository:  git clone https://github.com/XOSDX/credit-card-fraud-detection-system.git
2.  Navigate to the project directory:  cd credit-card-fraud-detection-system
3. Install the dependencies:  pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Open the Jupyter notebook: jupyter notebook PROJECT_2_CREDIT_CARD_FRAUD_DETECTION_SYSTEM_ON_BASIS_OF_MULTIPLE_FEATURES_WITH_NECESSARY_EXPLAINABILITY_USING_LIME_XAI_MODEL.ipynb

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the data by handling missing values, scaling, and splitting into training and test sets.
2. **Model Training**: Train the model using a suitable classification algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, random forest).
3. **Prediction and Evaluation**: Make predictions on the test set and evaluate the model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
4. **Explainability with LIME**: Use LIME to interpret the predictions for individual instances, highlighting the influence of each feature in the decision.

## Results

The notebook provides detailed analysis and visualizations, showcasing the effectiveness of the fraud detection model along with the LIME explanations.
